Description: Converts the SLURM `sbatch` and `sacct` commands' duration to ISO 8601 durations.
    The SLURM accounting fields, describing job statistics, and the `sbatch`
    command's `-t` & `--time` options' duration format to ISO 8601 durations.
    The format used by SLURM is ISO-like, being similar to the T(ime) portion
    of an ISO 8601 date-time string, whereinstead the day field is separated
    from the time field(s) with a hyphen/minus instead of a capital T.
    This package is quite simple, with no dependencies and only suggests
    the lubridate package. You may wish to use another package for working with
    dates, as long as it supports IS0 8601 durations.
